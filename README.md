# Clab Config Validation

## Overview
`Clab Config Checker` is a simple tool designed to automate configuration management for network multi-vendor routers. It covers the full lifecycle of configuration files, including **generation**, **validation**, and **deployment**. I am tying to make a tool supports multiple network vendors like Nokia, Juniper and Arista with plans to expand to others in the future and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions to enable continuous integration workflows for configuration testing and deployment.
